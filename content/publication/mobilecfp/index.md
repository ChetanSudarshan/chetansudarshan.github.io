abstract: The smartphone industry is advancing rapidly, emphasizing the development of smaller, energy-efficient devices with enhanced features. However, this progress often overlooks the significant environmental impacts of these ubiquitous devices. While corporate sustainability reports from mobile product companies aim to address these concerns, they typically provide high-level overviews that obscure critical details, particularly regarding the carbon footprints (CFP) of individual components such as processors and memories. This paper investigates the discrepancy between the overall CFP trends reported and the actual increasing CFP contributions of processors over the years. Through a detailed analysis, the inadequacies in current reporting practices are highlighted, underscoring the necessity for more granular data and metrics in corporate sustainability reports. Specific, detailed metrics are proposed for inclusion in these reports to enhance transparency and help align the chip architecture, design, and manufacturing communities toward addressing relevant sustainability-related challenges.

summary: The smartphone industryâ€™s push for smaller, energy-efficient devices with advanced features often overlooks environmental impacts. Corporate sustainability reports provide broad overviews, masking critical details, especially about carbon footprints (CFP) of components like processors. This paper examines the gap between reported CFP trends and the rising CFP contributions of processors, highlighting deficiencies in reporting practices. We propose specific metrics to improve transparency and guide chip design and manufacturing toward sustainable solutions.
